                  <p>Cyber Den is a browser-based cyber security training platform, with learning content covering all skill levels from the complete beginner to the seasoned hacker. Learning cyber security previously entailed a black-box approach with a lack of guides and challenges, leaving the industry incredibly tricky for people to break into and difficult for those already in-market to upskill continuously. This is where we come in!</p>

                  <p>In response to the rising demand for skilled cyber security professionals and the widening skills gap, CyberDen was created. Our mission is to break down barriers to entry by providing affordable and accessible cyber security education. Expensive courses and certifications often deter individuals from entering the field, but at CyberDen, we strive to make learning resources available to all.</p>

                  <p>Before CyberDen, cyber security education primarily focused on theoretical concepts, leaving learners with significant gaps in practical application and engagement.</p>
                  <p>At CyberDen, we provide users with their own personal virtual machine, which can be deployed with just a click of a button. This hands-on approach enables learners to actively practice hacking and defending machines, mirroring real-world scenarios and job roles. Our immersive training methodology aligns with market demands and enhances retention through experiential learning.</p>
